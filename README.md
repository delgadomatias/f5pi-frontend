<p align="center">f5pi-frontend is a cool project that lets you manage users, players, fields, seasons, and games. It hooks up with a <a href="https://github.com/EzeSosa/f5pi-backend">backend</a> that handles all the behind-the-scenes stuff.</p>

## Showcase
Below are some screenshots to give you a quick peek at what f5pi looks like in action.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
